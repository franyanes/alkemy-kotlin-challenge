# Alkemy Kotlin Challenge

### Overview

This is my take on the [Kotlin Challenge provided by Alkemy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19sWXyPTBQ-dTeov779GZyid572iu9c0o/view).

This app is a simple movie catalog that lets you browse through the most popular movies provided by [TheMovieDataBase API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and pick a choice to look at the movie's details such as rating, release date, and more.

### Screens

##### Popular Movies Catalog

The list of movies are shown in a card view. Each item on the list shows the title and poster image of a movie.

The user can go up and down in the view when searching. 

To select a movie, simply press on it.
